Subject: Do you have student discounts for the Annual Coding Conference?

Greetings,

I would like to ask if you provide student discounts for tickets to the Annual Coding Conference.

I’m a full-time student at the University of Texas and I’m very excited about your event, but unfortunately, the ticket price is too high for me. I would appreciate if you could offer me an educational discount.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Jon Jones
